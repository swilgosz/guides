## Prerequisites

Before we get started, let's get some prerequisites out of the way.
First, we're going to assume a basic knowledge of developing web applications.

In this guide, we'll be using an [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database.

If you want to follow along, make sure you have a working installation of Ruby 2.3+ and SQLite 3+ on your system.

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

- [Model, View, Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) paradigm.
